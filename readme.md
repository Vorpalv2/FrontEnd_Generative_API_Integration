This is a test program using ejs as a simple front end to received the question then answer it through google's generative AI API with model gemini Pro

I might update it later for more features in the future but we will see.
No ETA for that right now

PS. the roadmap in case i do decide to update it in the future

################################

convert the code to TS format
possibly seperate the frontend logic from the backend and keep both of the in seperate directories.
